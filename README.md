# Vet Management Project - Version 1.0
Solo Project for CodeClan created by Gary Darnell

## Usage:
The Vet Management App has been designed to aide in keeping records for a vetinary service. It allows the user to create, read, update and delete an animal
profile. These actions can also be extended to owners and vets in the database. All of this can be done in the UI. The app also allows for limited searches as 
of version 1.0. These allow the user to search by; animal name, animal type and the animals under the care of a chosen vet.

## Installation:
In order to run this app with seed data running console.py is not required. The seed files are part of the database (vet_management.sql).
